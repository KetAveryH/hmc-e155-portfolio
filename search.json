    "text": "Ket Hollingsworth is a senior at Harvey Mudd College, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. His passion for the intersection of hardware and software took root during his sophomore year when he joined the MuddSub underwater robotics club. Since then, Ket has delved into research at the nexus of systems and machine learning, investigating methods to transition machine learning from the cloud to the edge while considering energy constraints. He is also the founder and software lead of ExploraVist.net, a startup developing an AI-powered wearable device to enhance perception for the visually impaired, utilizing machine learning and sensory substitution. Under his leadership, the team secured $60,000 in investments and enrolled in the 2024-2025 Clinic program at HMC. Outside of academics, Ket enjoys spending time with his family, playing volleyball with friends, and making music."

    "text": "In this course I hope to get better at reading through intense documentation. I want to be confident with debugging with an oscilloscope along with other tools that allow me to debug hardware at a very low level. I believe this will give me the fundamentals I need to work in the field of embedded engineering!"
