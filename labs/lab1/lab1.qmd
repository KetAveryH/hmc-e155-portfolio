## Introduction

In this lab, a verilog module was implemented on the FPGA to control LEDs and interface with a 7-segment display. This lab demonstrates the ability to write modular verilog that interfaces with hardware, along with the ability to build, assemble, test, and debug circuits.

## Design and Testing Methodology
The on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24MHz. Then, a counter was used to divide the high frequency clock signal down to a frequency of 2.4Hz which was then easily visualized using one of the on-board LEDs. We used the FPGA's Programmable Logic Blocks (PLB) in order to drive two LEDs and our 7 segment display. LED0 followed the logic of a xor operation and LED1 followed the logic of an AND operation. The inputs of LED0 and LED1 were driven with 4 individual switches each assigned their own GPIO input pin and either outputted 3.3V logic. We then tested the logic of the 4 switches and ensured that our inputs aligned with the expected outputs.

The next step was to integrate the 7 segment display logic. Using the same 4 individual switches, they would encode a binary value from 0-15 which would be represented on our 7 segment display using Hexadecimal values 0-F. Upon reviewing the 7 Segment Display it was found that the model number was KYX-5101AS with a shared cathode. This meant there a shared 3.3v rail between all diodes, and each individual diode pin would have to be pulled to ground for current to form. Each diode was rated for 20 mA, so consequently 10mA was chosen as the target current. It was calculated that a 150 ohm resistor between each diode and ground would be sufficient. After this all GPIO pins were set to high (the default state of our combinational block) and each individual diode was prodded with a grounding wire to ensure each LED lit up appropriately without any unusual behavior. From this point on the Combinational Logic was programmed, GPIO pins were assigned, and the sequence of binary values from 0-15 were tested to see if the appropriate hexadecimal values 0-F were displayed.

### Block Diagram

The block diagram in Figure 1 demonstrates the overall architecture of the design. The top-level module lab_1 includes 3 submodules: 
- HZ_blink which drives an LED2 at 2.4Hz.
- led_blink which drives LED0 and LED1 using combinational logic and our 4 switches as inputs.
- seven_seg_display which drives our seven segment display using combinational logic and our 4 switches as inputs.

### Schematic

Figure 2 shows the physical layout of the design. Internal 100 $k\ohm$ pullup resistors were use to ensure that the diodes defaulted to 3.3v as to not power on any diodes. In order to ensure that each LED on the 7 segment display maintained a 10mA of current again we used 150 $\ohm$ resistored between the diode and our GPIO pins.

## Results and Discussion
At the conclusion of this lab I was able to display a set of hexadecimal numbers on a 7-Segment Display that was being driven by a 4 DIP switch module. In order to do this I learned how to incorporate combinational logic blocks in my verilog code, and also drove a set of LED's with simple AND/OR logic depending on DIP switch positioning. I was also able to successfully make use of the onboard High Speed Oscillator (HSOC) in conjunction with a counter module to blink an on board LED at 2.4 Hz. Overly the completion of this lab demonstrates the ability to write modular verilog, along with the ability to build, assemble, test, and debug circuits.

## Testbench Simulation
![Figure 3: ModelSim Testing](images/waveform.png){width=400}
To verify the 7-Segment Display logic I forced our 4 bit s input to take on every value from 0-F in Hexadecimal. Upon reviewing the outputs of the seg variable I was able to verify that each output was as expected in our set of cases that I outlined. This was then further verified upon deployment of the verilog code to the FPGA. In future labs I plan on setting up a test bench environment for a more streamlined simulated verification process.
